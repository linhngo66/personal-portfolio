I recently explored the world of computational statistics, or put it simply, building softwares that implement statistical theories. For me, it was **building new visualization methods and softwares** that can help me better understand the data I'm working with.

[`prefviz`](https://numbats.github.io/prefviz/) is a new R package for interactive and high-dimensional ternary plot that I developed, along with my supervisors Di and Damjan. Hopefully I can publish it on CRAN (aka production version of R packages) by end of March 2026!
