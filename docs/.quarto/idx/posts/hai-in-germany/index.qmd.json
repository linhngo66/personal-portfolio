These infections can arise from a variety of sources, including infections from patients, staff, and equipment. \n\nThis study focuses on five most common HAIs, namely:\n\n- Healthcare-associated Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI)\n- Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP)\n- Healthcare-associated primary bloodstream infection (BSI)\n- Healthcare-associated urinary tract infection (UTI)\n- Surgical site infection (SSI)\n\n## How is HAIs-related health burden measured?\n\nThe author measures HAIs-related health burden through 3 key metrics:\n\n- The number of HAIs incidence\n- The number of deaths attributed to each HAI\n- The number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to HAIs: DALYs is a measure of years of lost healthy life, combining years of life lost (YLLs) with years lived with disability (YLDs).

You can find out more about their methodology through the accompanying R packages [BHAI](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BHAI/index.html).\n\n## What does the data reveal?\n\nA substantial and concerning burden of HAIs is found in Germany, especially when benchmarked against other European countries, and other communicable diseases. \n\n### Overall HAIs-related health burden\n\n![Annual burden of five types of HAIs in Germany](images/table1.png){#tbl-table1}\n\nThe study estimated 478,222 cases of the five selected HAIs in Germany, leading to 16,245 attributable deaths and 248,920 DALYs (@tbl-table1).\n\nTo put these number into perspective, the author benchmarked the burden of HAIs against other common communicable diseases like influenza, Salmonella, hepatitis B, and measles. The comparison is staggering: The burden of all five HAIs combined (308.2 DALYs per 100,000 population) is almost eight times higher than the combined burden of four common communicable diseases (39.4 DALYs per 100,000 population).\n\n![Comparison the EU/EEA average further emphasizes a heavier national burden despite strong hygiene standards.](images/table2.png){#tbl-table2}\n\nFurthermore, the burden of HAIs in Germany is overall higher than the EU/EEA average, with HAIs incidence being 27% higher, attributable death being 29% higher and DALYs being 6% higher (@tbl-table2).\n\n### Disproportionate impact of HAIs\n\nThe sheer volume of HAIs is just one part of the story, but the analysis also revealed a crucial insights into where the true severity lies - fatality rate. \n\n![Contribution to overall burden is not evenly distributed across five HAIs due to differences in fatality rate, with HAP and BSI being much more deadly despite lower case number.](images/figure2.png){#fig-figure2}\n\nAs shown in @fig-figure2 and @tbl-table2, Healthcare-associated Pneumonia (HAP) and Primary Bloodstream Infection (BSI) were responsible for a whopping 51% of all DALYs, even though they represented only 28% of the total cases. In contrast, UTI registered 45% of all cases, yet only 27% of DALYs. These number show the deadly impact of HAP and BSI, calling for aggressive prevention measures for these diseases.\n\n### Reasons lie in the capacity challenge\n\nGiven the high hygiene standard imposed across German healthcare system, the existing substantial burden of HAIs is rather surprising. A deeper look into the system suggests the potential root cause being the country's large hospital capacity and high hospitalization rate. Even with generally good hygiene standards, a higher volume of patients being admitted means more individuals are exposed to the risk of acquiring an HAI. When you increase the population at risk, the overall incidence per general population rises, inflating the total burden metrics.\n\n## Conclusion: What we learnt and The way forward\n\nThe central question - *how severe is HAIs-related health burden actually in Germany?* - is answered by three key findings:\n\n- The absolute burden of HAIs in Germany is substantial (≈ 250,000 DALYs annually), yet impacts differ across types of HAIs due to varying fatality rate.\n- Relative to other diseases, HAIs account for almost eight times more healthy life lost.\n- Relative to other European nations, HAIs-related health burder in Germany is modestly but consistently 6% higher.\n- One potential driven for such heavy burden is from high volume of hospital admission, inflating the number of incidents and total burden metrics.\n\nSuch findings imply the critical role of reducing unnecessary hospitalization and continued adherence to hygiene and infection prevention measures on alleviating HAIs burden in Germany.\n\n# References\n\nZacher, B., Haller, S., Willrich, N., Walter, J., Abu Sin, M., Cassini, A., Plachouras, D., Suetens, C., Behnke, M., Gastmeier, P., Wieler, L.
