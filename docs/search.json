These infections arise during hospital care and are a major cause of avoidable deaths, disability, and healthcare costs across Europe.

Yet, data from Zacher et al. (2019) suggest that its infection burden may be higher than the European average.\nI’m exploring how severe HAIs-related health burden actually is, and what factors might explain the paradox of high infection rates in a strong healthcare system through a deep-dive into the paper “Application of a new methodology and R package reveals a high burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) in Germany compared to the average in the European Union/European Economic Area, 2011 to 2012” by Zacher et al. (2019)."

The comparison is staggering: The burden of all five HAIs combined (308.2 DALYs per 100,000 population) is almost eight times higher than the combined burden of four common communicable diseases .(39.4 DALYs per 100,000 population).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the burden of HAIs in Germany is overall higher than the EU/EEA average, with HAIs incidence being 27% higher, attributable death being 29% higher and DALYs being 6% higher (Figure 2).\n\n\nDisproportionate impact of HAIs\nThe sheer volume of HAIs is just one part of the story, but the analysis also revealed a crucial insights into where the true severity lies - fatality rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Contribution to overall burden is not evenly distributed across five HAIs due to differences in fatality rate, with HAP and BSI being much more deadly despite lower case number.\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 3 and Figure 2, Healthcare-associated Pneumonia (HAP) and Primary Bloodstream Infection (BSI) were responsible for a whopping 51% of all DALYs, even though they represented only 28% of the total cases.

A deeper look into the system suggests the potential root cause being the country’s large hospital capacity and high hospitalization rate.
