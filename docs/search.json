    "section": "",
    "text": "Hospitals are designed to heal, yet many patients leave them sicker than when they arrived — not because of their original illness, but because of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). These infections arise during hospital care and are a major cause of avoidable deaths, disability, and healthcare costs across Europe. Germany is known for its advanced medical infrastructure and high hygiene standards. Yet, data from Zacher et al. (2019) suggest that its infection burden may be higher than the European average.\nI’m exploring how severe HAIs-related health burden actually is, and what factors might explain the paradox of high infection rates in a strong healthcare system through a deep-dive into the paper “Application of a new methodology and R package reveals a high burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) in Germany compared to the average in the European Union/European Economic Area, 2011 to 2012” by Zacher et al. (2019)."

    "text": "What does the data reveal?\nA substantial and concerning burden of HAIs is found in Germany, especially when benchmarked against other European countries, and other communicable diseases.\n\nOverall HAIs-related health burden\n\n\n\nTable 1: Annual burden of five types of HAIs in Germany\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study estimated 478,222 cases of the five selected HAIs in Germany, leading to 16,245 attributable deaths and 248,920 DALYs (Table 1).\nTo put these number into perspective, the author benchmarked the burden of HAIs against other common communicable diseases like influenza, Salmonella, hepatitis B, and measles. The comparison is staggering: The burden of all five HAIs combined (308.2 DALYs per 100,000 population) is almost eight times higher than the combined burden of four common communicable diseases (39.4 DALYs per 100,000 population).\n\n\n\nTable 2: Comparison the EU/EEA average further emphasizes a heavier national burden despite strong hygiene standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the burden of HAIs in Germany is overall higher than the EU/EEA average, with HAIs incidence being 27% higher, attributable death being 29% higher and DALYs being 6% higher (Table 2).\n\n\nDisproportionate impact of HAIs\nThe sheer volume of HAIs is just one part of the story, but the analysis also revealed a crucial insights into where the true severity lies - fatality rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Contribution to overall burden is not evenly distributed across five HAIs due to differences in fatality rate, with HAP and BSI being much more deadly despite lower case number.\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 1 and Table 2, Healthcare-associated Pneumonia (HAP) and Primary Bloodstream Infection (BSI) were responsible for a whopping 51% of all DALYs, even though they represented only 28% of the total cases. In contrast, UTI registered 45% of all cases, yet only 27% of DALYs. These number show the deadly impact of HAP and BSI, calling for aggressive prevention measures for these diseases.\n\n\nReasons lie in the capacity challenge\nGiven the high hygiene standard imposed across German healthcare system, the existing substantial burden of HAIs is rather surprising. A deeper look into the system suggests the potential root cause being the country’s large hospital capacity and high hospitalization rate. Even with generally good hygiene standards, a higher volume of patients being admitted means more individuals are exposed to the risk of acquiring an HAI. When you increase the population at risk, the overall incidence per general population rises, inflating the total burden metrics."

There are three key data points I need for this analysis, namely rent price by suburb, crime rate by surburb and geospatial boundary of each suburb.\nI collected rent price data from 2021 Census GeoPackages - Table G02, where Median weekly rent is provided (2021). While there are more recent sources of rental prices available, they are either less comprehensive, often missing data on outer areas, or locked behind paywall. 2021 Census is the most complete data source on rental price with true open access. However, since my analysis is anchored in 2024, yet the data is from 2021, I need to adjust rent data using the 2021 and 2024 consumer-price index (CPI) provided by Australia Bureau of Statitistics (2025a).\nTo calculate the crime rate, defined as incident rate per 100 residents, I needed data on crimes and population in Melbourne. I collected data on all criminal incidents in 2024 from Victoria’s Crime Statistics Agency (CSA). CSA collects recorded crime from Victoria Police to process and release to the public every quarter, thus, is the most up-to-date and official data source on Victoria crimes. Regarding population data, I collected it from 2021 Census GeoPackages - Table G01 (2021). Similar to rental data, this data is from 2021, thus, needed adjusting by annual population growth rate, which is calculated from Estimated Resident Population (ERP) provided by ABS (2025b).\nThe 2021 Census GeoPackages also offer geospatial data on suburb level, called Suburbs and Localities (SALs). I use this data to visualize two key variables on a map.\nAll data from ABS are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence, and data from CSA are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia license (2025c; n.d.)"

I assume this is a good reflection of how rental price changes within Melbourne metropolitan areas.\n\n\nCalculate Incident rate per 100 residents\n\\[\n\\text{Incident rate per 100 residents} = \\frac{\\text{incident counts}}{\\text{population in 2024}} \\times 100\n\\]\n\n\nEstimate Population for 2024\nPopulation in 2024 is calculated by multiplying 2021 Census population by Population growth rate between 2021 and 2024.\n\\[\n\\text{Population in 2024} = \\text{Population in 2021} \\times (1 + \\text{ERP in 2024}/\\text{ERP in 2021})\n\\]\nAssumptions: While 2024 estimated population exists, they are not presented by suburb. Therefore, I need to calculate the population growth rate between 2021 and 2024 by assuming the reliability of this population estimate.\n\n\nHarmonising suburbs and local government areas between Census data and CSA data\nAssumption: There exists multiple suburbs that extend to more than one local government area (LGA) and metropolitan region, creating duplications when merging CSA data with Census data. This is because CSA data is presented by suburbs and LGAs, while Census data is presented by suburbs only. While this does not impact any calculation, it creates duplication during visualization.\nTherefore, where duplications among extended suburbs happen, I keep the first entry and assume that the suburb only belongs to one LGAs or metropolitan region.\n\n\n\nSuburb category based on Weekly rent and Incident rate\nLooking into the relative impact of rent and incident rate, I decided to categorize suburbs into 4 quadrants:\n\nUnderrated: Rent is lower than the median rent of alls suburbs, and incident rate is lower than the median incident rate of all suburbs.\nOverpriced: Rent is higher than the median rent of all suburbs, and incident rate is higher than the median incident rate of all suburbs.\nPremium Safe: Rent is higher than the median rent of all suburbs, and incident rate is lower than the median incident rate of all suburbs.\nCheap Risk: Rent is lower than the median rent of all suburbs, and incident rate is higher than the median incident rate of all suburbs."
