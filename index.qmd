## Hi, I’m Linh 

I build **data systems and business processes that connect business strategy with execution** — from designing analytics pipelines, data models, and dashboards that drive measurable impact, to building and optimizing team operations. 

### What I've done

My work sits at the intersection of **data analytics, analytics engineering, and business strategy**.  

I’ve built and scaled analytics in **fintech, SaaS, and consulting** — from optimizing data pipelines and implementing self-service analytics at a U.S. tech startup, to leading growth and customer operations at a Vietnamese fintech, and supporting a business transformation for a major bank client.

### What I’m focused on now

- Pursuing a **Master of Business Analytics at Monash University** to sharpen my analytical skills
- Diving deeper into **data engineering and pipeline design** - exploring how modern data stacks can bridge the gap between technical systems and business impact
- Optimizing my daily routine for maximum health, mental clarity and emotional regulation

### Tech Stack  

- **Languages:** SQL, Python, R 
- **Tools:** dbt, Airbyte, Fivetran, Airflow, Git, Power BI, Tableau, Google Data Studio
- **Cloud:** Snowflake, Azure Data Factory
- **Skills:** ELT & data modelling, CI/CD for pipelines, data quality monitoring, and metric standardization
