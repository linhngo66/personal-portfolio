## Hi, I’m Linh 

I build **data systems and business processes that connect business strategy with execution** — from designing analytics pipelines, data models, and dashboards that drive measurable impact, to building and optimizing team operations. 

### What I've done

Professionally, my work sits at the intersection of **data analytics, analytics engineering, and business strategy**. 

I’ve built and scaled analytics in **fintech, SaaS, and consulting** - from optimizing data pipelines and implementing self-service analytics at a U.S. tech startup, to leading growth and customer operations at a Vietnamese fintech, and supporting a business transformation for a major bank client.

Personally, I'm a long-distance runner, a frequent cafe-goer, a solo traveler, and a journaler. Fun fact: I have solo-travelled around SEA, I finish 13 journals every year on average. 

Find out more about my work through my blogs and github repo. 

### What I've been into lately

- Relearning and diving deeper into **data engineering and pipeline design** - exploring how modern data stacks can bridge the gap between technical systems and business impact
- Developing **new visualization methods** to support high-dimensional compositional data through my new R package [`prefviz`](https://numbats.github.io/prefviz/)
- Pursuing my project R1000, where I try to **get rejected 1000 times in 2026** to get more comfortable with rejections and more importantly, take myself closer to my career and life goals. (Last updated: 53 rejections by 2026-02-21)
